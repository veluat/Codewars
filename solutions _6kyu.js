/*Who likes it?

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.
*/

//My solution:

function likes(names) {
  if (names.length == 0) {
    return "no one likes this";
  } else if (names.length == 1) {
    return names[0] + " likes this";
  } else if (names.length == 2) {
    return names[0] + " and " + names[1] + " like this";
  } else if (names.length == 3) {
    return names[0] + ", " + names[1] + " and " + names[2] + " like this";
  } else {
    return names[0] + ", " + names[1] + " and " + Number(names.length-2) + " others like this";
  }
}


/*Break camelCase
Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

Example
"camelCasing"  =>  "camel Casing"
"identifier"   =>  "identifier"
""             =>  ""
*/

//My solution:

function solution(string) {
  return string.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1');
}

/*Find the unique number

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
*/

//My solution:

function findUniq(arr) {
  return +arr.filter((el, i, arr) => arr.indexOf(el) === arr.lastIndexOf(el));
}

/*
Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items
without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.
    For example:
    uniqueInOrder('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
uniqueInOrder('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
uniqueInOrder([1,2,2,3,3])       == [1,2,3]
*/

//My solution:

var uniqueInOrder=function(iterable){
    let result = [];
    if (typeof iterable === '') {
        iterable.split('');
    } else {
        for (let i = 0; i <= iterable.length; i++) {
            if (iterable[i] != iterable[i+1]) {
                result.push(iterable[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
